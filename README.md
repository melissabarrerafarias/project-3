  ## Project Description:
  Game for Matching Super Heros and keeping stats.

  ### User Story:
  ```
  AS A Super Hero Fan\
  I WANT USERS to Compare Super Heros so we can determine once and for all who the best super hero is\

  WHEN I log in\
  THEN I am presented with two super heros, for which i can cast a vote (using a big red button)\
  WHEN I vote for one of the superheros\
  THEN The winning Hero gets a point AND the loosing hero is removed in a dramatic way.\
  THEN the winning super hero is matched with a new hero and the game continues\
  WHILE i am logged in I have access to my homepage where I can see how I voted on previous matches. (OPTION stats by superhero universe etc can be added).
  WHILE I am logged in I have access to a super hero leader board where i can see a ranking of superheros by the number of votes they have received (OPTION sort the heros by superhero universe or other stats..).
  WHEN I loose network all my stats are still accessible, but the battle is now replaced by matches between Mozilla dino's with randomly generated superhero names.  
  ```
